This week officially kicks off the Nebraska Type Challenge, a 30 week typography experiment that Pixel Bakery is helping put on. Over the course of the next 30 weeks several talented designers in the Lincoln and Omaha area will be tackling one character a week. The first week's challenge character was an ampersand and provided some stunning results:

Since its beginnings in 2010, Instagram has gone through many phases in its identity. The cliché brunch posts, the photos of EVERY MEAL YOU EAT in hopes of becoming a food blogger, the workout selfies, the endless Starbucks cups, #nofilter, and the #OOTD (Mom, that means 'outfit of the day', by the way).

I'm not here to torment you with the posts of the past. I am, however, recommending who to follow to spice up your Insta to find inspiration in design and beyond. So, in no particular order, let's get started:

## 1. Steven Harrington (@s_harrington) | Los Angeles, USA

Steven has built a following of over 164k with his extremely recognizable cartoon-style and pop art colors. He's done work with the biggest boys out there and his art can brighten the day of anyone willing to check him out.

## 2. Jessica Walsh (@jessicavwalsh) | New York, USA

Nobody does it quite like the latter partner of Sagmeister + Walsh. The colors, the phrases, and the punchiness of her designs make her an iconic and must-follow for any designer.

## 3. Paul Fuentes (@paulfuentes_design) | Mexico

If you are into clever, clean, and striking design. This is your guy. Paul's use of color and form contributes to his success.

## 5. Antoni Tudisco (@antonitudisco) | Germany

Antoni is a master of 3D modeling. His work ranges from mind-bending to unsettling and features some of the greatest textures I've seen in design.

## 6. Lauren Hom (@homsweethom) | Detroit, USA

If hand lettering is your thing, @homsweethom is a must-follow. She has one of the most underrated personalities and styles of anyone I've seen on Instagram.

Seriously though, I hope these 7 accounts can inspire you to continue (or start!) creating. Exploring other's passions can lead to some of the greatest inspiration of all.

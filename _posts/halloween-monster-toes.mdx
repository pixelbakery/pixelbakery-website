Hey, look! We actually have an employee that can bake. Here's her recipe on monster toe breadsticks, just in time for Halloween!

Happy Fall Y'ALL. I can't believe it's already the end of October. I was starting to get worried that Nebraska was going to pull a fast one on us and skip right to winter. (EDIT: Today's October 30. It's snowing.) #BOO Anyways, I'm back again with a recipe that will channel your inner Frankenstein - just in time for Halloween.

Now as Pixel Bakery's primary baking expert, some of you may be wondering why I didn't opt to put in a recipe for homemade breadsticks. To put things simply, ain't nobody got time for that- especially not on Halloween!

Here's what you will need:

Ingredients:

1\. One small handful almonds, as many as 6-10 depending on breadstick size

2\. One can of Garlic Pillsbury breadsticks

3\. Butter

4\. A pinch of fresh Dill

5\. Marinara sauce

To start, you need to prep your almonds. First, take a small handful of almonds and place them in a pot of boiling water. The hot water loosens the skin on the almonds, so you will be able to peel them off with ease. Let the almonds boil for one minute. Then, drain the water and place the almonds on a paper towel to peel the skins off.

Next, you will want to buy a can of the Pillsbury Garlic Breadsticks. If you don't like garlic, please skip over this recipe. Open the can, or get a friend to like I do because the *pop!* of the can always scares me! Roll out the breadsticks on a non-greased baking sheet. Brush the top side of breadsticks with a butter wash.

Now, take your almonds and split them in half the long way. That way you will have a "toenail" for each breadstick. Press each almond about half an inch from the top.

Following the almonds, take a few pieces of Dill. The Dill represents the "toe hair." Gross, right?

Place the Dill a few centimeters below each almond.

Bake the Frankenstein Toes in the oven according to Pillsbury's instructions. Baking takes approximately 10-13 minutes at 375 degrees.

Voila! Now you have a platter of tasty Monster Toes to dip into some marinara sauce. Bring these to any Halloween Party, and you'll be the ghostess with the mostest.

## The Introduction

As a production studio and creative shop, we're naturally curious and always learning, using what we see in television and film in an attempt to answer our creative questions. At the same time, film forms and shapes us, and in some ways big and small, make us who we are. The first film I ever remember watching was *The Sandlot*, when I was probably around three years old. We had to rent it from Hollywood Video, and I watched it every single day we had it. It took a handful of repeated rentals until my parents finally broke down and bought it on VHS to keep. The second film I remember seeing was *The Sound of Music* at my grandma's house. She had maybe five things on tape total: *The Sound of Music*, some specials from late comedian Red Buttons, and some Johnny Carson program. And while I don't necessarily think much about watching that film there, every time I watch it now or see it somewhere in the world, I'm reminded of my time there -- when we would pick fresh fruit and vegetables from her garden and cook them for lunch before sending me to nap when her "stories" came on.

### The Takeaway

There is a decent amount of overlap between lists, but that wasn't really too unexpected. Overall, we are products of the era we grew up in, and like most people forced to make lists, have a fair amount of an [availability heuristic](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/availability-heuristic) thing happening (only 10 of our collective 60 movies came out before 1988). It's clear which films we grew up watching and remember fondly (90% of Elaina's list, *Toy Story*, *The Brave Little Toaster*) and how highly we hold acclaimed films that have premiered in the last 10-15 years as we grew up and our tastes matured.

### Questions

How is our diversity? Writers/directors/stars of color? How well are female artists represented?

Where's *The Godfather* franchise?

How was Karley able to choose only one *Harry Potter* film?

Is it time for IMBD to kick The Shawshank Redemption from its number one spot on their [list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top)?

Do I finally need to see *Spirited Away*?

And what we're all wondering: whose list is best? Let us know so we can fight internally.

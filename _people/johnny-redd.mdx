Johnny is a graphic designer and artist with a passion for the color pink. They graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in studio art, a minor in art history, and a LOT of student debt. Johnny loves urban planning, podcasts, and browsing Reddit, and hates haircuts, autoplay, and Diet Coke.

They are also a co-founder of [Strongly Worded Letters](https://www.stronglywordedomaha.org/), a political education team working to make local government more accessible to all.
